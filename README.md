# ecommerce-application

This repository will be a demonstration of my progress throughout Brad Traversy's MERN eCommerce From Scratch course (https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-ecommerce/)

I am following through the course to gain a better grasp on several concepts and practices, including Redux, Node, CRUD operations, and more.  The website will be a nearly fully functioning ecommerce store, with the exception that the 'payment' method will not deal with actual money, and will instead use a sandbox that will simply allow the site to simulate payment so we can proceed to checkout, delivery, et cetera.

Please note that much of this code will be done along with Brad Traversy, and I will note which modifications and functionalities are my own later on in the ReadME. The goal of this project is to touch-up on these concepts and test myself with my own knowledge, not to copy-paste code.

Enjoy!
